           In life emotion is fickle. It is said that to control ones emotional state is to harness absolute power. Some galaxians are born predisposed to certain emotions, while others grapple with the temptations of light and darkness incessantly. Ceaselessly grappling with the forces at be leaves many galaxians defenseless against darkness. Have you fallen to darkness? Has light prevailed? Proceed with caution to determine your side of the force, your allegiances, your character, but remember “You can’t stop the change, any more than you can stop the suns from setting.” — Shmi Skywalker.
